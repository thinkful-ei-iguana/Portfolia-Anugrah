        <section class="about-me">
            <p>When I was a teenager, I really wanted to go to art school. But instead my parents made me study engineering instead.
            I never lost my creative drive though, and I've now merged that creativity along with my strong technical background 
            to become the web developer that I am today.</p><p> To me, coding is one of the purest forms of creation and problem solving,
            and watching well written code at work is like watching an elegant work of art. </p>
            <p>
            If i'm not hunched over my computer writing code, I'm most likely training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (I'm a blue belt), 
            sending funny memes to my friends, or out enjoying one of the many drag shows here in chicago.
